A blueprint of the next-generation dialog system.

This is not an original idea (ideas rarely are). It's used to great effect in Ace Attourney.

Players can interject midway through a sentence or wait long after the other person has finished
their line. How does this work? A dialog choice appears at certain intervals:

Why is it cool?

This naturally implements cadence to video game dialogs. Usually, this is achieved through linear
dialogs or cutscenes, where you don't have any control. This implements cadence with interactivity.

As you'll see, it's also fun because you're exploring the character you play in a new kind of way.
Often in games, you make choices about what kind of character you are: evil or good; chaotic or lawful,
but rarely do you ever chance upon choosing between an impatient vs a calm and thoughtful character.
Those are often written in the script, which, though it works, is one step removed from actually
choosing how your character reacts.

Any cons?

It's expensive in terms of man-hours. In addition to a whole new level of constraints placed on a writer,
structure is important to any script. Branching on interjections can seriously tamper with the quality of the
structure in any dialog. It just makes it harder.

A quick prototype:

Future work:

Write full-fledged scenarios with this dialog system.
Use it for a comedic scene, a dark, emotional scene, and an action scene.
Use it! I would love to see a system like this be implemented in a game.
I'm not particularly fond of the code, but it's a prototype. I encourage anyone to build on this, rewrite it,
and make it better.

Things I learned

Struture is such an important part of writing a screenplay. Screenwriting is also such an interesting
process that I've become interested in it.

// KILLER FEATURE
* Should allow players to interject midway through a sentence or wait long after the other person has finished speaking.
KILLER FEATURE //

* Dialog-branch-independent reactions and responses. Pseudorandomness.
* Freeform responses (EG: typing your own response) to augment choosing from a list of prewritten responses.

        Certain responses are only available in a predefined time window.
        They pop in and pop out (perhaps slightly fade-in and out) 
        And you can select one with your cursor/keypress/gamepad

* Combine and matching dialog options. You needn't just choose one.
    Rethink this. This doesn't seem like an ideal design: what about
    dialog optiosn that can't be combined with another?

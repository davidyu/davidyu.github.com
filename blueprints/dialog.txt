A blueprint of the next-generation dialog system.

Players can interject midway through a sentence or wait long after the other person has finished
their line. How does this work? A dialog choice appears at certain intervals:

Why is it cool?

It naturally implements cadence to video game dialogs. Usually, this is achieved through linear
dialogues, where you don't have any control.

Any cons?

It's expensive in terms of man-hours. In addition to the stress on a writer, structure
is important to any script. Branching and interruptions can seriously tamper with the quality of the
structure in any dialog.

// KILLER FEATURE
* Should allow players to interject midway through a sentence or wait long after the other person has finished speaking.
KILLER FEATURE //

* Dialog-branch-independent reactions and responses. Pseudorandomness.
* Freeform responses (EG: typing your own response) to augment choosing from a list of prewritten responses.

        Certain responses are only available in a predefined time window.
        They pop in and pop out (perhaps slightly fade-in and out) 
        And you can select one with your cursor/keypress/gamepad

* Combine and matching dialog options. You needn't just choose one.
    Rethink this. This doesn't seem like an ideal design: what about
    dialog optiosn that can't be combined with another?

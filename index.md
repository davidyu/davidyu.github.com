I am a senior Computer Science student at Yale University. Currently, I'm interested in topics
related to compilers and operating systems, and in working on real-time applications in
computer graphics. Video game design and implementation fascinate me.

Games
-----

* Project Jumpman: a prototype for a local co-op physics-based platformer. Developed in Flash with Box2D
* Q-bert Clone: a nearly verbatim (but pared-down) clone of Q-bert. Developed in C++ with SPICE (SDL)
* Exorcist (7th ToJAM): a pretty cool local versus game about escaping a mine shaft. Developed in C++ with SPICE in co-operation with DreamyCactus. Our artist made up the name.

School
------

* TCP Reno: an implementation of reliable transport over the Java Fishnet network simulator. Developed for Yale's CS434 Computer Networks course.
* Tiger Compiler: a fully-featured compiler for the Tiger toy programming language. Developed in Standard ML for Yale's CS421 Compilers and Interpreters course.
* Raytracer: a raytracer. Developed for Yale's CS478 Computer Graphics course.
* Stroboscopik: a neat prototype of a decentralized and synchronized strobing app for Android devices.

I am a senior Computer Science student at Yale University. Currently, I'm interested in topics
related to compilers and operating systems, and in working on real-time applications in
computer graphics. Video game design and implementation fascinate me.

Work and Projects
=================

Games
-----

* Project Jumpman: a prototype of a local co-op physics-based platformer
* Q-bert: a pared-down clone of Q-bert
* Exorcist (7th ToJAM): a pretty cool local versus game about escaping a mine shaft
in co-operation with DreamyCactus

School
------

* TCP Reno: an implementation of reliable transport over the Java Fishnet network simulator
* Tiger Compiler: a fully-featured compiler for the Tiger toy programming language
* Raytracer: a raytracer
* Stroboscopik: a neat prototype of a decentralized and synchronized strobing app for Android devices.
